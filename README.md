## Overview

Retina is a cloud-agnostic, open-source **Kubernetes network observability platform** that provides a **centralized hub for monitoring application health, network health, and security**. It provides actionable insights to cluster network administrators, cluster security administrators, and DevOps engineers navigating DevOps, SecOps, and compliance use cases.

Retina **collects customizable telemetry**, which can be exported to **multiple storage options** (such as Prometheus, Azure Monitor, and other vendors) and **visualized in a variety of ways** (like Grafana, Azure Log Analytics, and other vendors).

## Features

- **[eBPF](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf#what-is-ebpf)-based** Network Observability platform for Kubernetes workloads.
- **On-Demand** and **Configurable**.
- Actionable, industry-standard **Prometheus metrics**.
- Streamlined **Packet Captures** for deep dives.
- **Cloud-agnostic**, supporting multiple OS (like Linux, Windows, Azure Linux).

## Why Retina?

Retina lets you **investigate network issues on-demand** and **continuously monitor your clusters**. For scenarios where Retina shines, see the intro docs [here](https://retina.sh/docs/intro)

## Documentation

See [retina.sh](http://retina.sh) for documentation and examples.

## Capabilities

Retina has two major features:

- [Metrics](https://retina.sh/docs/metrics/modes)
- [Captures](https://retina.sh/docs/captures)

### Metrics Quick Install Guide

Prerequisites: Go, Helm

1. Clone the repo, then install Retina on your Kubernetes cluster

    ```bash
    make helm-install
    ```

2. Follow steps in [Using Prometheus and Grafana](https://retina.sh/docs/installation/prometheus-unmanaged) to set up metrics collection and visualization.

### Captures Quick Start Guide

#### Captures via CLI

Currently, Retina CLI only supports Linux.

- Option 1: Download from Release

  Download `kubectl-retina` from the latest [Retina release](https://github.com/microsoft/retina/releases).
  Feel free to move the binary to `/usr/local/bin/`, or add it to your `PATH` otherwise.

- Option 2: Build from source

  Requirements:

  - go 1.21 or newer
  - GNU make

  Clone the Retina repo and execute:

  ```shell
  make install-kubectl-retina
  ```

Execute Retina:

```shell
kubectl-retina capture create --help
```

For further CLI documentation, see [Capture with Retina CLI](../docs/installation/cli.md).

#### Captures via CRD

Prerequisites: Go, Helm

1. Clone the repo, then install Retina with Capture operator support on your Kubernetes cluster

    ```bash
    make helm-install-with-operator
    ```

2. Follow steps in [Capture CRD](https://retina.sh/docs/captures/#option-2-capture-crd-custom-resource-definition) for documentation of the CRD and examples for setting up Captures.
